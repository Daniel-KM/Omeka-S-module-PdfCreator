/**
 * There can be only one folder of fonts (subdirectories are allowed), so you
 * may need to copy them in your own directory and pass the options "fontDir"/"fontCache"
 * to the pdf creator. This is only needed when not-standard fonts are used.
 * Common default fonts are available in vendor/dompdf/dompdf/lib/fonts.
